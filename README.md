PythonJoust
===========

## Fork Info:
I found @StevePaget made a very nice starting point for a joust game! So far I haven't added much, perhaps more to come, but I did make it playable online using pygbag for wasm conversion:

https://depsypher.github.io/PythonJoust/

## Original Readme:
A version of Joust, the old arcade game. I'm just making this for fun, and to brush up my Pygame skills.

Requirements:

Python 3 (get the latest one from python.org)

Pygame (get the latest one from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame )

Run joust.py and enjoy!
Feel free to fork and let me know how it goes.
